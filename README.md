# Pre-Angular instructions

Starting from "FigmaIntoMui", the instructions were auto-generated by Angular. To follow those, there are a few pre-requisites. 
If there are questions at any point, feel free to reach out. (^_^)

## Installing Node.js/npm

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it (the installer will ask for permission to make changes to the operating system)

## Check installation

After the installation, check if everything was properly installed.
Open the Windows terminal (Windows + X and choose one of the Terminal options).
`node -v`
`npm -v`
With both, there should be a version output

## Install IDE (Visual Studio Code)

Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.

## Install Git

Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install it 

## Check Git installation

Open a terminal and enter `git --version`. There should be a version output.

## Clone repository

Navigate to your repo folder on the terminal `cd C:\Users\{your user}\source\repos`
Click on the "Code" button on the top of the page.
Choose one of the clone URLs and enter it in the terminal: `git clone {clone URL}`

## Open folder in VS Code
This can easily be achieved from the terminal, simply enter `cd` and press TAB.
This will suggest the folders, press it until the correct folder appears.
Then enter `code .` - with the dot, the current folder is opened in Visual Studio *Code*

# FigmaIntoMui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
